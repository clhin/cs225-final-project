# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We will try to meet at least once a week for one or two hours for each week. This is not a set in stone schedule, as all of us have different schedules. We will be using discord to hold these meeting, and we will generally have a design document to note any design decisions.

2. **Assistance** 
Our minimum response time for each person will be 24 hours. Formal communications should be done over email, informal questions can be asked over discord.

3. **Respect** 
We will follow the golden rule of treating others the way we'd like to be treated. We will have a voting system which we will mention later for conflict resolution.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Each person will be generally assigned an algorithm, with the fourth person being assigned data parsing tasks. This is not set into stone, we can help one another with each algorithm, and we will share collective responibility for the "plumbing" tasks (build systems, git management, etc.). We will communicate any unforseen circumstances with one another as to not let someone drown in labor.

5. **Time Commitment** 
We will make a minimum time commitment of 2-3 hours per week. If conflicts come up, we promise that we will communicate with our teamates to make sure equal work is distributed and to plan ahead for unforseen accidents and holdups.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will have a voting system for any conflicts. In the event of a split vote, we will contact our TA advisor for advice on which way the tie should be broken, if we remain at an impasse, we will flip a coin. We will practice lowest level conflict resolution if one of our group members is not fulfilling their obligations, if this fails to be effective, we will contact the TA to report the situation.
